CHROME CANARY
TESTING PROJECT




I chose to test Chrome Canary, an experimental app from the Google Chrome family whose purpose is to launch new features in order to improve them before making it available to all users in the original version. On its page, it warns us that since it is an untested version, it could be unstable.

I took three features to test: new user registration, login and the time range filter of the search tools.

For the test management, I chose to use JIRA XRAY because it has a very organized and adequate structure to create test sets, test cases, to carry out test execution and because it also allows us to generate all the documentation in PDF format. However, it seemed to me that the generated XRAY document was a little unclear and not easy to read, so I decided to create a document of my own where everything was exactly as I wrote it in Jira, but in a clearer and more understandable way to make it more enjoyable to read. 

This project has helped me a lot to settle much of the knowledge I have acquired throughout all the courses I took, as well as encouraging me to keep learning new things (like using XRAY, for example!) to continue improving as a tester.

For this project, I performed the following tasks:


Analysis of the app and its features, 
Test case design and Test set design, 
Test Execution, 
Detection of 2 bugs, 
Bug report, 
Test report, 
Evidence collection.
